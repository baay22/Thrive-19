                    <h1>How to Find the Right Hobby for You</h1>
                    <p>Remember that sweet, blissful headspace of doing something when you were a kid just because it held your interest and was fun? A lot of us adults forget that’s an actual thing. You probably didn’t call it having a hobby then—that was a weird term for old people who had to find time for things.</p>
                    <p>Well, now that we are those old people, finding time for hobbies is every bit as important as it was for us to have that time to be a kid. When you find the right one, it’s like medicine—for stress, anxiety, and just plain feeling stuck in a rut. It becomes something you look forward to, giving you a sense of productivity and fulfillment that can carry over into the rest of your life.</p>

                    <h2>The Older You Are, the Higher the Risk—but There Are Ways to Lower Your Risks</h2>
                    <p>It’s a common mistake to think you don’t have any free time, so you just do what’s right in front of you, like mindlessly scrolling social media or distracting yourself with the innumerable devices engulfing all of us. But if you bundle up all the time you spend on stuff like that it’s likely you’ll have a couple hours you can dedicate to something. It’s also important to understand that you don’t have to be good at your hobby or impress people with it—it’s something you’re doing for your own enjoyment. It defeats the purpose to apply a work mindset to a hobby.(1)</p>

                    <h2>Ask Yourself Some Questions</h2> 
                    <p>Hobbies present an escape—they can help us get out of our heads and calm down. Ask yourself how you want an activity to make you feel: Engaged? Distracted? Relaxed? Connected? Think about what you feel your life is missing and allow that to guide your choices.(2)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What kind of topics pique your interest the most when others bring them up?</li>
                        <li>If you wrote a story, what would it be about?</li>
                        <li>What kinds of <a href="https://www.thrive-wa.com/why-keeping-books-a-part-of-our-lives-is-so-important/">books</a> and movies do you find yourself seeking out the most?</li>
                        <li>What are your biggest guilty pleasures?</li>
                        <li>If you went on a trip, where would you go and why?</li>
                        <li>What kind of people do you admire the most?</li>
                        <li>What makes you feel the most peace?</li>

                    <h2>Embrace Nostalgia</h2>
                    <p>So, about that kid thing above—childhood is a great place to find inspiration for choosing a hobby. Sure, we change and grow throughout life, but the root of our joy is often right where we left it. Think back to the activities you loved as a child. You may unlock interesting things you’ll enjoy today.</p>
                    <p>A hobby can sprout from the subjects you enjoyed the most in school or the activities you participated in at home. If you were crafty, maybe things like painting, sculpting, or textile art may appeal to you now too. If you loved performing skits, you could try an improv group. If you were athletic, you could join an adult recreational sports team.(3)</p>

                    <h2>Assess Your Personality</h2>
                    <p>Our personalities define what we think is fun. Do you want to share your hobby with others? Could a hobby be a way for you to get some treasured alone time that is lacking in your life? Maybe you want a hobby that gives you the opportunity for a bit of each. Are you more of a feeler or a thinker? Are you an observer or rely on intuition? You might find taking the Myers-Briggs(4) will make some things jump out that you haven’t thought about.</p>

            <section>
                    <h2>Start Trying Things</h2>
                    <p>The truth is, no matter how you approach finding a new hobby, it can be hit or miss. And that’s okay. It might take a few attempts to find one you love. Keep putting yourself out there and trying new things. Even during the exploration process, you’re connecting with yourself and others in ways that will inevitably lead you where you want to go. And don’t be afraid to try some things you wouldn’t normally think of yourself doing—pick something that feels random and give it a whirl. There are all kinds of things inside of us that just need a spark.</p>
